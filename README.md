# Open Source Vanilla Block Remakes (OSVBR)  

**Mission Statement**  
OSVBR aims to provide stable, high-quality, and feature-compliant recreations of Minecraft blocks for addon developers. Our goal is to ensure consistency, reliability, and ease of use for creators who want to expand Minecraft’s building possibilities while maintaining vanilla fidelity.  

**Guidelines**  
- All remakes must function as close to vanilla as possible.  
- Performance and stability take priority over excessive features.  
- Contributions must adhere to Minecraft Bedrock’s addon framework.  
- All submissions should be well-documented and follow best practices.  

**Get Involved**  
- Submit issues for missing or broken recreations.  
- Contribute block recreations following the guidelines.  
- Discuss improvements and optimizations with the community.  

Let’s build together! 🚀
